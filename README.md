# Power Plant Unit Commitment

This project addresses the **unit commitment problem** for a thermal power plant with four generation units over a 24-hour horizon. The objective is to design a **cost-optimal, cyclic scheduling strategy** that balances efficiency, startup costs, demand uncertainty, and long-term investment decisions.

## Project Overview

* **Problem Type:** Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)
* **Context:** Power generation scheduling
* **Planning Horizon:** 24 hours (5 demand periods)
* **Key Features:**

  * Deterministic model with fixed demand
  * Stochastic model with demand uncertainty (normal distribution, Ïƒ=10 MW)
  * Sensitivity to external power price fluctuations
  * Capacity expansion analysis for long-term investments

## Models

1. **Deterministic Model**

   * Fixed demand across 5 periods
   * Optimal cost: **4026.5 kkr**
   * Strategy: operate fewer units for longer durations to minimize startup costs

2. **Stochastic Model**

   * Demand modeled as normally distributed random variable
   * 100 demand scenarios sampled
   * Optimal expected cost: **4106.2 kkr**
   * Accounts for demand variability and robustness

3. **External Power Pricing**

   * Base case: 10 kkr/MWh
   * Reduced by 50% â†’ total cost: **4056.2 kkr**
   * Increased by 50% â†’ total cost: **4108.0 kkr**

4. **Capacity Expansion**

   * Expanding Units 1 & 3 (+15 MW each) reduced total cost to **3994.2 kkr**
   * Improves efficiency and reduces external power reliance

## Results & Insights

* **Unit Commitment:** Units 1 and 3 are most cost-effective due to high capacity and low running costs
* **Uncertainty Costs:** Stochastic optimization raises costs by ~79.7 kkr (Value of the Stochastic Solution) but ensures robustness
* **External Power Prices:** Scheduling is sensitive to market fluctuations; cheap power reduces reliance on internal units, expensive power increases it
* **Investment Strategy:** Expanding Units 1 & 3 is the most profitable long-term investment
